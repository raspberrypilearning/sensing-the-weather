# Lesson 1: General orientation

## Introduction

This lesson will introduce the concept of a weather station and why we need one to build one. It serves as a general introduction to the scheme of work and will orientate the students to give them a general overview of the goals they will work towards.

Predictions about future weather can have no credibility unless they are based on the analysis of scientifically gathered measurements. So what can we measure and how can we do it scientifically?

Firstly consider the characteristics of weather that we might want to predict in a forecast. These might include:

Characteristic | Meaning
--- | --- 
Temperature  | The measurement of hot and cold
Air pressure | The force per unit of area exerted by the air
Air quality | How contaminated the air is
Humidity | The amount of water vapor in the air
Rainfall | A depth per unit area of rain
Wind direction | The direction *from* which wind is blowing
Wind speed | The force exerted by the wind

Next consider what equipment we will need to measure each of these things. A nice class activity here is to ask everyone to name a device that they have seen or used that can measure one or more of the above weather characteristics. See how many they can name? This is a great opportunity to use some props if available.

Here is the full list of instruments:

Characteristic | Measurement device
--- | --- 
Temperature | Thermometer
Air pressure | Barometer
Air quality | Specialised sensor
Humidity | Hygrometer
Rainfall | Rain gauge
Wind direction | Weather vane
Wind speed | Anemometer

Next ask the class to think about how they would record data from these instruments. We're going to need a lot of data. *Lots*. Ideally we need to monitor all of these characteristics as they change over a long period of time so that trends and patterns can be sought.

The answer is that with most of those instruments you would need to visually *look* at it and then write down the measurement. Ask the class what else we might want to record in the interests of being scientific.

Measurement | Reason
--- | --- 
Date and Time | Ties the measurement to a specific time allowing for comparison to other measurements taken at earlier or later times
Location | Ties the measurement to a specific place allowing for comparison to other measurements taken at different locations and for plotting on a map

So how are we going to gather all this data? Let's suppose we want to take a reading from each of the instruments once every five minutes. Ask the class if there are any volunteers to sit outside in a shed day and night writing down numbers from those instruments?

The problem is that people need rest and there is also the issue of human error. Even if people were to work in shifts there is the possibility that mistakes will be made when writing down the measurements. What we need is some kind of automatic machine that doesn't need sleep. What we need is a *computer!*

We could easily program a computer to take the measurements every five minutes. We can then just leave it unattended and it will happily continue to record measurements until the end of time. But how are we going to connect the sensors to it?

The answer is we need a computer that has a general purpose interface.
