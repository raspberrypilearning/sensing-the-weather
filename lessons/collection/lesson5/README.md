# Lesson 5: The wind vane

![](../../../images/wind_vane.png)

## Introduction

## Resources

Students should work in pairs. Each pair will require the following equipment:

- Raspberry Pi
- Weather Station Expansion Board
- Wind vane
- Micro USB power adaptor
- An SD Card with Raspbian already set up through NOOBS
- USB keyboard
- USB mouse
- HDMI cable
- A monitor or TV
- A small phillips screwdriver (magnetic if possible)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how the wind vane works
- Be able to differentiate between analogue and digital signals
- Understand the purpose of an Analogue to Digital Converter
- Understand digital communication using the I²C protocol
- Use these technologies to determine the direction the wind vane is pointing

## Starter

A wind vane shows the direction *from which* the wind is coming, not where it's going (this can be confusing because TV weather maps show it the other way around). It works by the wind exerting force on a vertical blade which rotates to find the position of least resistance, this position is then aligned with the direction of the oncoming wind.

Also known as a weather vane these are often found as decorative adornments at the highest point on buildings or churches. Typically taking the shape of a cockerel, horse or ship.

### How it works

The wind vane is the most complex of the sensors studied so far. It does use reed switches and magnets but it works in a completely different way. Ask the students to pull the top off their wind vane, it should come off without much force. On the underside you'll again find the metal cylinder which is the magnet.

*Note: Disassembling the next part is only recommended for students with good motor skills. Younger students may have difficulty reassembling it.*

Next take the screwdriver and remove the three screws in the base, slide the base panel down the cable a bit to get it out of the way. If you look inside now you'll see there are eight reed switches arranged like the spokes of a wheel. Remove the three remaining screws allowing the circuit board to come free. Do not lose these screws.

Examine the green side of the circuit board now, this is the side that faces upward inside the wind vane. The magnet points down onto it. North is at the top in the picture above, where the two black clips for the anemometer socket are.

Look closely and you'll see there is a ring of metal that goes all the way around the edge. There is also a smaller ring in the centre. Each reed switch connects to the outer ring to the inner ring through a resistor. You'll see that `SW1` (switch 1) has `R1` near it (resistor 1), similarly `SW2` has `R2` and so on up to 8.

So what is going on here? Firstly students need to understand what a [resistor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor) is. These are small components that resist/reduce the flow of electrical current but do not stop it, at the same time they also reduce the voltage moving through the circuit. Resistors can have different values, a low value would let almost all voltage/current through but a high value would let very little through.

The wind vane is working like a big variable resistor, think of a volume knob. Look at the schematic diagram below (a zigzag line is the symbol for a resistor). The idea is that voltage comes in on the outer ring and can take a path through any of the switches to the inner ring which is connected directly to ground. As the magnet rotates different reed switches will open and close and thus switch their corresponding resistor in and out of the circuit.

Each of the 8 resistors have different values which you'll see printed in white text next to them, this then allows the wind vane to have 16 possible combinations of resistance since the magnet is able to close two reed switches when half way between them.

Reassemble the wind vane now. Firstly locate the letter N on the side of the base, insert the circuit board with the green side facing away from you so that the anemometer socket aligns with North. Replace the three smaller screws (this step can be tricky and a magnetic screwdriver helps a lot). Next replace the base ensuring the knot in the cable remains inside. Finally replace the three larger screws.

### How can we measure it?

So we now understand that the wind vane is essentially a variable resistor similar to a volume knob. Resistance is something that we can't measure directly because it's a passive property of the wind vane. What we need to do is measure something that changes as a consequence of the resistance. Namely the *voltage* going through the wind vane. The voltage level will go up and down as different resistors are switched on and off. That we *can* measure.



## Main Development

### Setting up your Pi

1. Place the SD card into the slot of your Raspberry Pi.
1. Connect the Weather Expansion Board to the GPIO pins.
1. Connect the wind vane to the socket marked *WIND* on the Weather Expansion Board.
1. Next connect the HDMI cable from the monitor or TV.
1. Plug in the USB keyboard and mouse.
1. Plug in the micro USB power supply.
1. When prompted to login type:

    ```bash
    Login: pi
    Password: raspberry
    ```
