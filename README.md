# Weather Station Basic Input / Output

![](cover.png)

This scheme of work introduces students to Raspberry Pi Weather Station. A project which aims to get schools children building and programming their own weather station to collect and present data. This is the first of a series of activities which introduces some simple sensors and get the students writing Python code to gather data from them. 

To find out more about the weather station, the schemes of work and how to get one use the following links:
